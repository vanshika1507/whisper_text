# whisper_text
This project involves creating a Python-based application for transcribing and translating audio/video content, featuring automatic language recognition, speaker diarization, and text-to-speech synthesis. Leveraging advanced AI models like Whisper and WhisperX for transcription and Google APIs for translation and speech synthesis, the application provides an efficient and accurate solution for handling diverse audio inputs. The implementation, detailed in a Google Colab notebook, highlights the integration of multiple libraries and the use of GPU support to enhance processing speed, while addressing challenges such as dependency management and GPU memory optimization.
